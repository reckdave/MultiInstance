# MultiInstance
Made for the bounty / mods

# STILL BEING MADE AND CHANGED

# HOW TO USE
- No more and one mod can edit your world, Kinito is also replaced so it conflicts with KinitoFIXES
- Copy the code and paste it in ur project
- Replace `MAINInstance.DATA` in saveLoc and rename it to something unique
- Use the file system format, e.g edited your_world in `res://-Scenes/NewInstance/1/1.tscn`
- Custom instance can also be made, just create a folder in NewInstance name give it a unique number
