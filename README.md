# MultiInstance
Made for the bounty / mods

# STILL BEING MADE AND CHANGED, EXPECT SOME KINITO BUGS

# HOW TO USE
- When want to open your_world, you would have to get the mods location and call .openInst()

# HOW THE F#CK DOES THIS WORK?!?
- The mod creates a file in Kinitopet_DATA called `Instance.DATA`, the mod reads and writes in this file. Everytime the game launches, it reads the file, if the first key in DATA is true it would change the scene to the key name
